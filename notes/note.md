Unit 1.1 Boolean Logic

    Commutative Law
        x AND y = y AND x
        x OR y = y OR x

    Associative Law
        x AND (y AND z) = (x AND y) AND z
        x OR (y OR z) = (x OR y) OR z

    Distributive Law
        x AND (y OR z) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
        x OR (y AND z) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)

    De Morgan Law
        NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)
        NOT(x OR y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)

Unit 1.7 Project 1

    Elementary Logic gates
        Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux (Multiplexor), DMux (Demultiplexor).

    16-bit vatiants
        Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16.

    Multi-way variants
        Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way.

    NB
        Multi-bit busses (unit 1.6) are indexed right to left:
        If A if a 16-bit bus, then A[0] is the right-most bit, and A[15] is the
        left-most bit
